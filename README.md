SyncSpin
========
SyncSpin - Where the whole party has a voice, but no one has to shout.

Our web app provides a flat interface to track and play only the best songs for your next get together. We built a system just for you so that your party will DJ itself through the input of your loyal friends. There are no apps or downloads to SyncSpin either, we took care of that leveraging the latest in cross-platform cloud technologies.

Getting Started
---------------
When you find yourself on [the SyncSpin homepage](http://www.syncsp.in/), you will need to create a room (unless you are joining a friend). After a quick API cridential verification with Beats (Thanks @Mashery!), you are now hosting a room. With the sharable URL at the top, anyone with an internet can join you. This is where the fun begins
