SyncSpin
========
SyncSpin - Where the whole party has a voice, but no one has to shout.

Syncspin is a democratic DJ music streaming application.
---------------
When you find yourself on [the SyncSpin homepage](http://www.syncsp.in/), get started by clicking "Create Room" (unless you are joining a friend).
You will then be instructed to connect to your Beats Music account to allow streaming.
The next page is the "Sentence Builder". The "Sentence" is a unique feature of the Beats Music system that allows one to generate an auto-curated playlist based on factors such as location, mood, and genre.
After you have built your starter sentence, you will find yourself on the "Room" page.
At the top of the "Room", there will be a URL that looks like "http://www.syncsp.in/SOME_ANIMAL_HERE". Anyone with an internet connection and modern web browser can now connect to your room via this URL and vote on the next song to be played.


Visualisation
---------------
You may notice a "ping" of small circles appear on the main screen when someone connects to the room
This ping is a visualizer of all devices connected to the playback server.
Try shaking your smartphone or tablet while it is connected to a room and see what happens...

We hope you enjoy syncsp.in as much as we do. Happy jammin'!
